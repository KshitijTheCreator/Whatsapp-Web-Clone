## Description

- This is a chat application which has similar UI of that of the Whatsapp web. 
- This is application follows the monolithic architecture. My main focus during building the project was to gain hands-on practice with the frontend development in react.js, which is a JavaScript Framework.
- I have not hosted it anywhere as of now, I have gone through the instructions for setting up the project locally which is very simple. 

#### Project Setup

- Create the database locally in the system. (I have given the name as the whatsapp). This can be done simply by providing the details in the **application.properties** in the resource directory.
- Head to the Client Section, which is the frontend portion for our application install **stomp.js**, **sock.js** and **net** from the terminal using npm.
- run client and backend project. make sure to make changes in config file of the backend depending on the port the project is running.

#### Technologies

- Spring Boot framework for building the backend support. 
- React.js for the frontend.
